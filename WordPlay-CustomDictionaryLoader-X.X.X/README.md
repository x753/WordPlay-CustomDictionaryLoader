# CustomDictionaryLoader

This mod is a library that loads custom dictionaries, which will add new words to the valid word list.

## Creating a Custom Dictionary

- Create a .txt file
- Add words to it, separated by new lines
- Put it inside "BepInEx/plugins/CustomDictionary/"
- Zip it up with an icon.png, README.md, and manifest.json file (https://wiki.thunderstore.io/mods/creating-a-package)
